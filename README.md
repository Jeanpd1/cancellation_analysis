# Customer Cancellations Data Analysis

## Import Note

Due to Plotly using JavaScript to render its graphs, GitHub does not display them. Therefore, I am providing the link to the notebook on Google Colab below:

## Introduction
This project analyzes customer cancellations using a dataset provided in a CSV file. The main goal is to understand the factors that contribute to cancellations and provide insights to improve customer retention.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and standardizing the data by removing blank entries.
- **Cancellation Analysis**: Examining cancellation rates and their proportions.
- **Contract Types Analysis**: Analyzing the impact of different contract durations on cancellations.
- **Graphical Representation**: Visualizing data to identify key factors influencing cancellations.
- **In-depth Analysis**: Highlighting major pain points.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language used for the analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive visualizations.

## How It Works
1. **Setup**: Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed.

2. **Data Preparation**: Ensure your data is stored in a CSV file.

3. **Analysis Process**:
   - Load and visualize the dataset.
   - Remove blank entries for data standardization.
   - Analyze cancellation rates and the impact of contract types.
   - Create visual representations using `plotly` to identify key factors.
   - Perform in-depth analysis.

## Notes
- Ensure your CSV file and Python script are in the same directory, or provide the full path to the CSV file.
- Customize the analysis as needed to fit your specific dataset and requirements.
- Test with a small subset of data before running the full analysis to ensure accuracy.

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Data Quality**: Ensure the CSV file contains valid and complete data.
- **Visualization**: Use interactive graphs to make the data easier to understand.
- **Customization**: Adjust the analysis parameters to suit your specific needs.

## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into the factors driving customer cancellations. By addressing issues such as service delays and frequent call center interactions, companies can significantly reduce cancellations and improve customer satisfaction.

Feel free to modify and expand this project to suit your needs!
